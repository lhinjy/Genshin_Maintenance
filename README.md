# Genshin_Maintenance
This is a streamlit app! It adopts a minimalist and simple UI, that simply shows the time for the maintenance for a game that enjoy. It adjusts the timing accordingly to the country or to the time zone.

#  Motivation 
I wanted one, so I decided to make it myself.
*inserts the "fine, I will do it myself meme"*

# Some final words
I really REALLY REALLY wanted to implement the 3rd option( 1st:country, 2nd:time zone), by geolocation. Sadly, the idea is not feasible due to the potential costs :(
